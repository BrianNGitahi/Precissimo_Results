# ML-Quantum-Methods
Snippets of work I did to understand the [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.022060) on quantum observable estimation with neural networks RBM example in Fall '25
- 4_QST_BeH2_orig is Giacomo's original notebook made w NetKet 2
- DataGen_doc is a notebook documenting how I generated training data to be used by the RBM
- The other three notebooks are where I replicated the original notebook using NetKet 3
    - netket_rbm detailed -- has everything documented with the correct result
    - netket_rbm clean -- result without documentation
    - netket_rbm -- one of the original notebooks I worked with to debug the old data and the netket QSR driver
